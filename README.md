#### **'Climate Crisis' Font**
- Used for: INNER FORCE logo and headings, as well as IF favicon
- Climate Crisis delivers a bold, impactful aesthetic reminiscent of traditional Star Wars title sequences, therefore we strategically used it to draw the users attention to important elements, such as our logo and key headings. This font adds an engaging and thematic element to the app aesthetics, without compromising accessibility.
